# Disease_Detection_based_on_Symtoms
A focused comparative analysis of SVM, and Bayesian machine learning approaches for disease diagnosis and predictive healthcare applications. 
Overview
This project focuses on disease prediction based on patient symptoms using machine learning classification algorithms.
The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes models for accurate disease detection and diagnosis support.

Objectives
Build a supervised learning model that predicts diseases based on input symptoms.
Compare accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score between SVM and Naive Bayes.
Identify the algorithm best suited for multi-class medical diagnosis with limited and overlapping symptom data.
